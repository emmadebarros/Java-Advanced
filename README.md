# Mini Projects - Programming 3, Advanced Java
## Description

These are mini projects source codes that were created for the purpose of the Programming 3 - Advanced Java Programming course, with professor [Gregory Prokopski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prokopski/) ðŸ”—.

In this course, we dove deeper into the advanced Object-Oriented Programming features of the Java language such as encapsulation, inheritance, the concept of static, interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism. We were also exposed to eventdriven programming and creation of graphical interfaces in desktop software.

## Usage

You can run these applications in the Apache NetBeans IDE.

Make sure to download [mysql-connector-java.jar file](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.23/source-code) and [opencsv.jar file](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/com.opencsv/opencsv/4.1/source-code). 

Also, for some of these projects, you'll notice that you need a database (SQL) with seed data to run them.

## Technologies Used
